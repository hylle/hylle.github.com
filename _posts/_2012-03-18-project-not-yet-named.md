I am currently working with a friend, on a master's thesis in Webcommunication and webarchitecture. We are designing and building a web-application in Ruby on Rails.
The application will be an e-learning platform, that doubles as a knowledge base. Our goal for the application is for it to support e-learning activities and facilitate communication between employees, in a small-business that mainly employs university students.

We are heavily invested in making the application a joy to use, unfortunately, we won't be getting many points for the actual graphical design and layout of the application, which is why we've chosen to use Twitters bootstrap as our foundation. Since the application isn't being built for heavy exposure, having a somewhat generic style won't matter as much.

We are hoping for the application to be put to use shortly after we graduate. Which is part of the reason why we will put a fair amount of effort into making the application both easy and enjoyable to use, by focusing on usability from the get-go. Furthermore we are considering various ways to motivate our future users. Which is why we are currently also focusing heavily on [persuasive technology](http://captology.stanford.edu/) and to some extent also gamification.

Most of the functionality that we want to build is already mapped out, and we are currently ramping up to start the actual programming work. Though it is still too early to say which, or how many features will make it in to the final application, but I'm planning to use this site to share some insights on the project and the experiences that might come with it.
