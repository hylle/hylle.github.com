Whiletrue has contained a static splash page since i bought the domain back in 2008, but lately I've wanted put it to better use. So this will be my N<sup>th</sup> attempt at starting a blog. (If this is still on the frontpage in 2013, or later, then this is another failed attempt - my bad.)

I usually start out by making a design in HTML and CSS, or rather [SASS](http://www.sass-lang.com) using [Compass](http://www.compass-style.org). Usually I get pretty close to having a full site ready, but then the final task creeps up on me, making content. It's at about this time that I loose interest and conveniently "forget" about my little project.
This time I wanted to try a different approach. Which is why I'm putting a site online that isn't quite finished yet. Which I hope will motivate me to keep improving on it, in the hope that it will get better over time.

## What else is new?
I'm glad you asked. The site now uses Jekyll to generate at static site, instead of using a traditional CMS. Posts and pages are written i Markdown and are converted into what you are seeing right now. I used [Jekyll Bootstrap](http://jekyllbootstrap.com/) to get me started, and the whole thing is hosted on [Github](http://www.github.com), which is pretty neat.
Apart from that I've tried to keep it simple, and for now I am avoiding a few of the usual default pages, such as the seemingly ever-present "about me" and "contact"-pages. For now the front/landing-page will contain the single newest post, and the navigation is limited to recent posts, the post archive and an index of static pages, which at the moment is rather empty.

In the following months I plan on writing a few posts about my thesis work and sharing some insights gained while building our Rails application.
